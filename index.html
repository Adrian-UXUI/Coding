    <h1> ADRIAN FERNANDEZ</h1>
    <h2> UX/UI Designer & Architect based in Berlin</h2>
<br>
    <p> 
        Always interested in how people interact with all that surrounds them from a city scale to a product one. In 4 years working as an Architect I learned a technical approach to solving problems and how to deliver constructive design solutions. Now I want to focus my skills on how people interact with the digital world. Drawing and sketching are the tools I use to find solutions.
